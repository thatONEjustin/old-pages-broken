So this has been a really cool programming exercise as I utilize astro and tailwind to build a site that acts as if it's dynamic but is being 100% rendered statically through GitHub Pages. 

I'll need a way to figure out how I'd like to handle images but I think maybe just doing static assets will be fine since I they can be optimized further by astro.
