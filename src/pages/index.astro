      <div class="about-timeframe">
        <h3 class="text-pink">2009 - 2016</h3>
        <h4><a class="text-cyan no-underline" href="https://advantageservices.net" target="_blank">AdvantageServices</a></h3>
      </div>

      <p>I started professional web development in 2009 back in the SFTP, jQuery, and early PHP days. I worked at a small b2b agency that handled dozens of clients on a regular basis handling every portion of the stack.</p>
      <p>During this time I had already picked up working in a lot of LEGACY web technologies. My first few frameworks were Wordpress and Drupal respectively. Eventually I really got a taste of backend UI development through a combination of ColdFusion/ActionScript and XML parsing.</p>
      <p>I built control panel UI/UX frameworks for every use case in several global scale niche hiring firms <a href={resume}>(ask me about it!)</a>.</p>

      <div class="about-timeframe mt-8">
        <h3 class="text-pink">2016 - now</h3>
        <h4><a class="text-cyan no-underline" href="https://wojodesign.com" target="_blank">WojoDesign</a></h3>
      </div>

      <p>This was a big move for me both in going from Florida to Chicago, and finally moving towards more modern tech stacks in web development.</p>
      <p>I wrote my first JS to mobile application for a client, that involved allowing users to purchase native in-app subscriptions for both the apple AppStore and google's Play Store.</p>
      <p>About 2016 - 2018 was a lot of me learning tools like yarn, npm, node, liquid/handlebars. I also started delving into more backend CMS development.</p>
      <p>This was also the time period where I really leaned into more systems administration and automation workflows.</p>
      <p>From 2018 onwards I put a bigger focus on deepening my relationship with programming and web development.</p>
      <p>I continue to build and/or integrate user management systems and login front ends. I also developed a few internal plugins for the Craft CMS platform.</p>
      <p>I've been incorporating more and more workflows that involve CI/CD practices for code deployment and environment management.</p>
